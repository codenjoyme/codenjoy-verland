## What is the game about

You have to write your own bot for the hero that beats the other bots
on points. Each player plays on his own field. The hero can move
through the free cells in all four directions.

On his way, the hero may encounter infestations. If the hero becomes infected. 
he will die. The hero does not know where the sources of infection are,
so he may attempt to perform a healing ritual in a restricted area 
in a given direction. For each successful healing the hero will receive 
bonus points[*](#ask). For his death he receives penalty points[*](#ask).

You can see if there is an infection around the cell by walking on it. If it has
there's a number - it means there's a corresponding number
infected. If there is no number - all around is clear.

Points are added up. The player with the most points wins (before the agreed
time).

[*](#ask)The exact number of points for any action as well as other
settings at this point in the game, check with Sensei.
